This challenge was an easy level challenge if someone noticed those strange spaces in the HelloWorld.cpp file. Yea those were Whitespaces(an estoric language). At first it was an easy looking challenge n it was. Decoding the whitespace gave us a strange output which certainly was not the flag.

So using an online whitespace decoder (https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/) , there was a tab of stack looking at which revealed some ascii codes which made a string i.e our FLAG :P

Another easy challenge from tamuctf. This time it's android ... :P So we're given a .apk file to begin with. First thought when given a .apk challenge is to decode it using apktool. 
> apktool decode howdyapp.apk

It will create a directory howdyapp/ under which the standard android source files. Next is to look for the MainActivity.java inside the source files. Some Challenges have their flags inside the MainActivity.java file but this one had nothing. So I started looking for .xml files and got strings.xml under values/

which contained all the strings used in the app and there it was hiding behind the base64 encoding ... decoding it using
> echo Z2lnZW17aW5maW5pdGVfZ2lnZW1zfQ== | base64 -d

gave the flag
